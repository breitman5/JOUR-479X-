## Trae Young is one of the best players in the NBA. However, interestigly enough, the Hawks starting lineup is one of the worst +/- on the team at -26. However, in two lineups that have Trae Young in them that have both played over 80 minutes, they have +/- of 21 and 11. In those two lineups, Young is the only player that appears in both lineups. The other four players in each lineup are a mix of starters and bench players.
